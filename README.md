## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to integrate things like Vite and SCSS, but this was my first time trying out a frontendmentor challenge, so I tried to keep the deployment pretty simple
